# RaphaÃ«l radar chart

## Radar chart implemented with [Raphael.js][raphael]

Works where Raphael.js works (Firefox 3.0+, Safari 3.0+, Chrome 5.0+, Opera 9.5+ and Internet Explorer 6.0+).

Only 2.35 KB (1.01KB gzipped) -very lightweight!

## [Example](http://valve.github.com/g.raphael-radar/example)

## Basic usage

``` 
var paper = Raphael('some_div_id', 800, 800);
paper.radar(cx, cy, radius, data_array, options);
```

To see real example, have a look at test/index.html 

### Options

This chart can be customized by passing the options that will override the default values, for example

``` 
paper.radar(400, 400, 300, [4, 8, 15, 16, 23, 42],
  {    
    meshSize: 30,//the space between adjacent meshes,
    labels: ["USA", "Canada", "Sweden", "Ukraine", "Uzbekistan", "Russia"],
    labelFontSize: 20, //huge font
    drawLabels: true, //to draw labels or not
    armFill: 'none', //color of arm fill
    armStroke: 'rgba(255, 106, 0, .5)', //color of arm stroke
    armStrokeWidth: 1, //width of arm stroke
    drawArms: true, //to draw arms or not
    meshFill: 'none', //color of mesh fill
    meshStroke: 'rgba(120, 120, 120, .5)', //color of mesh stroke
    meshStrokeWidth: 1, //width of mesh stroke
    drawMesh: true, //to draw mesh or not
    max: 100, //maximum value, if not present, calculated from maximum value of data array
    pathFill: 'none', //color of data path fill
    pathStroke: '#0026ff', //color of data path stroke
    pathStrokeWidth: 3, //data path stroke width
    pathCircleOuterRadius: 4, //data path circle outer radius
    pathCircleInnerRadius: 2, // data path circle inner radius
    drawPathCircles: true //whether to draw the circles on the data path 
  });
```
